     * Pattern:
     *  General problem statement for this pattern can vary
     *  but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big
     *
     * Statement:
     *  Given two strings s1 and s2, return some result.
     *
     * Approach:
     *  Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.
     *      for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
     *          for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
     *              if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
     *                  dp[i][j] = code
     *              }
     *              else {
     *                  dp[i][j] = other code
     *              }
     *          }
     *      }
